class AcceptRequestViewController: UIViewController { //4 //33mins //36mins the main purpse of this VC is you want to take the right request put it on the map and we want to be able to have the driver be able to say OK yes I want to take this ride, hit the button and then launch Apple maps so they can get some directions about how to go get that user
